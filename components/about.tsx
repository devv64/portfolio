        After graduating with an undergraduate degree in{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">Computer Science</span>, I decided to pursue my
        passion for programming. I enrolled in a masters at Cornell and continued studying{" "}

        <span className="italic">My love for programming</span> comes from the ability to solve any problem. I <span className="underline">love</span> the
        feeling of finally figuring out a solution to a problem. My core stack

          React, Next.js, Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB
        </span>
        . I am also familiar with Python and Django. I am always looking to
        learn new technologies. I am currently looking for a{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">full-time position</span> as a software
        engineer after I graduate with my masters in May 2025.
